Title: Multi-Analysis Distance Sampling
Version: 0.1.6
Author: Laura Marshall
Maintainer: Laura Marshall <lhm@st-and.ac.uk>
Description: Performs distance sampling analyses on a number of species 
    at once and can account for unidentified sightings, model uncertainty 
    and covariate uncertainty. Unidentified sightings refer to sightings 
    which cannot be allocated to a single species but may instead be 
    allocated to a group of species. The abundance of each unidentified 
    group is estimated and then prorated to the species estimates. Model 
    uncertainty should be incorporated when multiple models give equally
    good fit to the data but lead to large differences in estimated
    density / abundance. Covariate uncertainty should be incorporated
    when covariates cannot be measured accurately, for example this is 
    often the case for group size in marine mammal surveys. Variance 
    estimation for these methods is via a non parametric bootstrap. 
    The methods implemented are described in Gerodette T. and Forcada 
    J. (2005) <10.3354/meps291001> Non-recovery of two spotted and spinner 
    dolphin populations in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.
