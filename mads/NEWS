Notes

  * These methods were designs to replicate the analyses of those in Gerrodette and Forcada (2005)
    Currently we are still in the testing phase to ensure the methods in mads match those of Gerrodette and Forcada
    Our pro-rating methods for individuals are the same, but in addition we also pro-rate clusters.
    We do not perform model averaging only model selection at each iteration.
    There may be small differences in how covariate uncertainty is incorporated.
